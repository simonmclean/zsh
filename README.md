# âœ¨ ZSH Config

### ðŸ“¦ Installation instructions for my future self

Install [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/).

Replace the contents of `~/.zshrc` with `source ~/<path-to-this-config>`.

Some plugins are not part of the [OMZ core library](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Plugins). Just go to the relevant repos for installation instructions on those.
